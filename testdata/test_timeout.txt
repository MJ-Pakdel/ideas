Test Document for Timeout Fix

This document contains some entities that the LLM should extract:
- John Smith works at Microsoft Corporation
- The project deadline is December 15, 2024
- Contact email: john.smith@microsoft.com
- Location: Seattle, Washington

We're testing if the timeout fix allows the IDAES system to process this document completely and return the analysis results to the web client without timing out.

The previous issue was that the LLM processing completed successfully (taking about 25 seconds), but the IDAES subsystem had a 500ms timeout in the processRequest method, causing it to timeout before the response could be sent back to the web client.

With the fix, the IDAES subsystem now has a 3-minute timeout, which should be sufficient for the LLM processing to complete and the response to be properly coordinated back to the requesting client.
