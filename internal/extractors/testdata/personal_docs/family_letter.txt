Dear Mom and Dad,

I hope this letter finds you both in good health and high spirits. I wanted to update you on what's been happening in my life here in San Francisco.

Work has been incredibly exciting lately. I got promoted to Senior Software Engineer at TechnoLogic Systems last month, which came with a nice salary bump and more responsibilities. My manager, Sarah Chen, has been really supportive throughout this transition. The company is working on some cutting-edge AI projects, and I'm leading a team of five developers on a natural language processing initiative.

I've been living in the Mission District for about six months now, and I absolutely love the neighborhood. My apartment is at 1247 Valencia Street, just a few blocks from Dolores Park. The area has amazing restaurants - last week I tried this incredible Mexican place called La Taqueria that you would both love. They make the best carnitas I've ever had!

On a personal note, I wanted to let you know that I've been dating someone special. Her name is Emily Rodriguez, and she's a pediatric nurse at UCSF Medical Center. We met at a coffee shop called Blue Bottle Coffee back in March, and we've been inseparable ever since. She's originally from Portland, Oregon, but moved here for her residency program. I think you'd really like her - she's kind, intelligent, and has this infectious laugh that brightens up any room.

Speaking of relationships, I finally got in touch with my old college roommate, David Kim. Remember him from Stanford University? He's now working as a data scientist at Google in Mountain View. We had lunch at this great Vietnamese restaurant in Palo Alto called Pho Saigon last Tuesday. It was so good to catch up after all these years.

I've also been taking some photography classes at the San Francisco Art Institute on weekends. My instructor, Professor Martinez, is helping me develop my skills in portrait photography. I've been using my new Canon EOS R5 camera that I bought from B&H Photo Video for $3,899. I know it sounds expensive, but the image quality is incredible, and it's been worth every penny.

Health-wise, I've been doing well. I had my annual checkup with Dr. Angela Foster at Kaiser Permanente last week, and everything looks good. She recommended that I continue with my morning jogs around Crissy Field and maybe add some strength training. I've been thinking about joining the Equinox gym on California Street.

I also wanted to share some exciting travel news. Emily and I are planning a trip to Japan in November. We're going to spend a week in Tokyo and then take the bullet train to Kyoto. I've already booked our flights through United Airlines for $1,245 each, and we're staying at the Hotel New Otani Tokyo for the first part of our trip. I can't wait to visit the Senso-ji Temple and try authentic ramen!

On the financial front, things have been looking up since my promotion. I've been putting aside $2,500 each month into my 401(k) at Fidelity Investments, and I also opened a high-yield savings account with Marcus by Goldman Sachs that's earning 4.25% APY. Dad, I know you always emphasized the importance of saving early, and I'm finally taking that advice to heart.

I've been staying in touch with our extended family too. Cousin Jennifer from Chicago called me last week to let me know that Uncle Robert is doing well after his surgery. She mentioned that he's been staying with Aunt Susan in Milwaukee while he recovers. I'm planning to visit them during the Christmas holidays if work permits.

Oh, and I almost forgot - I finally replaced my old Honda Civic with a Tesla Model 3 that I purchased from the Tesla dealership in Fremont for $47,990. The insurance through State Farm costs me $180 per month, but the car is amazing. No more gas stations, and the autopilot feature makes the commute to work so much more relaxing.

In my spare time, I've been volunteering at the San Francisco Food Bank every other Saturday. It's incredibly fulfilling work, and I've met some wonderful people there. The coordinator, Mark Thompson, has become a good friend, and we sometimes grab coffee afterwards at this local place called Ritual Coffee Roasters.

Technology-wise, I've been keeping up with the latest trends. Apple just announced the iPhone 15 Pro, and I'm tempting to upgrade from my iPhone 13. The new titanium design looks incredible, and the improved camera system would be perfect for my photography hobby. Amazon has it listed for $999, but I might wait for Black Friday to see if there are any deals.

Mom, I know you've been worried about me eating properly, so I want you to know that I've been cooking more. I bought this amazing cookbook called "Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat" by Samin Nosrat, and I've been trying new recipes every week. Last Sunday, I made a delicious osso buco that even impressed Emily, who's usually the better cook between us.

I hope everything is going well back home in Denver. How's Dad's retirement treating him? Is he still working on that model train set in the basement? And Mom, are you still taking those pottery classes at the community center? I'd love to see some photos of your latest creations.

Please give my love to everyone, and let me know when might be a good time for a video call. I miss you both so much and can't wait to see you again soon.

With all my love,

Michael

P.S. Emily says hello! She's looking forward to meeting you both when we come visit for Thanksgiving.
